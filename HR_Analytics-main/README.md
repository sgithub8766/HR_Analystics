Welcome to my Employee Retention Analysis project! ðŸ“Š

Project Overview: In today's dynamic business landscape, retaining top talent is crucial for organizational success. This project focuses on leveraging HR Analytics to gain deeper insights into employee retention trends using Microsoft Power BI. By examining historical data, we aim to provide actionable insights for HR professionals and decision-makers to enhance employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and drive business growth.

Key Features:

Data Exploration: Dive into the dataset to understand employee demographics, tenure, and performance. Retention Metrics: Calculate key retention metrics such as attrition rates, churn analysis, and tenure distribution. Visualization: Utilize Tableau's and Power BI's rich visualization capabilities to create interactive dashboards and reports. Predictive Modeling: Explore predictive analytics to anticipate employee churn and identify at-risk individuals. Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations to improve employee engagement and retention strategies. Tools Used:

Microsoft Excel,Microsoft Power BI, Tableau desktop and MySQL:

In my current HR Analytics project, I leverage a combination of MS Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL to conduct Employee Retention Analysis. Using MySQL, I extract and organize relevant employee data, including demographics and performance metrics. and I used a variety of tools to extract, transform, and load the data. I leveraged advanced Excel functionalities such as data validation, conditional formatting, logical functions and lookups and references and pivot tables to clean and organize the data. I also used SQL to join multiple tables and extract data needed for analysis.

Once the data was organized and cleaned, I used Tableau to create a variety of visualizations such as bar charts, lollypop charts, and heat maps to understand the relationships between different employee attributes such as age, gender, department, and job role. This allowed me to identify trends and patterns that were important for employee retention.

Finally, I used Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that incorporated all of the insights from the analysis. The dashboard included a variety of metrics such as average monthly income stats, attrition rate, work-life balance, year since last promotion, and working hours by department and job role. The dashboard allowed HR managers to quickly and easily monitor and analyze employee retention data and make informed decisions based on the insights derived from the data.

Overall, this project was an excellent opportunity for me to showcase my skills as a data analyst and use a variety of tools to extract insights from complex datasets. I'm excited to continue exploring these tools and techniques and contribute to the data analysis community. The dynamic nature of these tools allows stakeholders to interact with the data and gain actionable insights.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to your collaboration and feedback!
